# Legendre-s-Conjecture
Python Program for Legendre\’s Conjecture
It says that there is always one prime number between any two consecutive natural number\’s(n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, …) square. This is called Legendre\’s Conjecture.
Conjecture: A conjecture is a proposition or conclusion based upon incompleate information to which no proof has been found i.e it has not been proved or disproved.

Mathematically,
there is always one prime p in the range n^2 to (n + 1)^2 where n is any natural number.

for examples-
2 and 3 are the primes in the range 1^2 to 2^2.

5 and 7 are the primes in the range 2^2 to 3^2.

11 and 13 are the primes in the range 3^2 to 4^2.

17 and 19 are the primes in the range 4^2 to 5^2.
